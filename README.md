# mini-metroidvania-p5js

Initially, this was my game project submission for a university module. It was fun implementing a 2d metroidvania MVP from scratch. I decided to put the lessons learned from https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/ to practice and improve my code with design patterns.

### TODO

- [ ]  Rewrite input handling using the Command pattern. This will clean up the input handling code and enable me to introduce an AI manager.
- [ ]  Add the Observer pattern everywhere where it applies. Most of my technical debt revolves around hard-coded reactions to "events" in random places.
- [ ]  ???
- [ ]  Profit!

### Running the game

Why would you? Anyway, set up a [web server](https://simplewebserver.org/) and choose the directory with this repository.


# A warning to UoL students

**Do not copy/draw inspiration from this repository!** ITP1 is an introductory module that assumes this is your more or less first experience writing code, the most rudimentary knowledge of OOP (which is taught differently in the module than it is implemented here), no prior experience organizing code, etc. This code has many mechanics and patterns not taught in the module, so refrain from cheating by using it. **You will be found out.**

# Asset use disclaimer
When I sourced the assets from itch.io, I did not track every link and then I only kept the files I used, so I don't have a list of credits here. Even though IIRC none of the assets required attribution, I still feel bad. I'm a dumb-dumb, don't be like me.
